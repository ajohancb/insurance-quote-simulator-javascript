# Welcome to the insurance quote simulator!

This project was created for practice purposes and serves as an example of how to build an insurance quote simulator using JavaScript and prototypes.

The purpose of this simulator is to provide users with an estimated insurance quote based on their input.

The simulator then uses this information to calculate an estimated quote and displays it to the user. 

We hope you find this project helpful in your learning journey and that it serves as a useful example of how to build applications using JavaScript and prototypes. 

Thank you for using our simulator.
